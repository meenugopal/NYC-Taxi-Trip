# NYC-Taxi-Trip - Domain : Transportation

This project, I would like to add some timeseries analysis for the trip taken by passengers on a particular day.

Also I want to see the pattern of taxi trips on a sepcific day, week and/or season.

In this project, I am using Dask and vaex to read the excel values as it is much faster than Pandas DF when comes to millions of records
